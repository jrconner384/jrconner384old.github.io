Hi, I'm Jason and I write code. And I write _about_ code.

By day, I'm a professional programmer with experience in the .NET and Java ecosystems. By night, I prowl the internet, looking for ways to be a better open-source developer.

I love learning new languages and just learning in general. I've been teaching myself Ruby in two ways: solving [Project Euler](projecteuler.net) problems and writing my own RubyGem, [OpenInteger](https://github.com/jrconner384/open_integer).
